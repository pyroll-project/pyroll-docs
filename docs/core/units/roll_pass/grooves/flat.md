# Flat Groove

```{py:currentmodule} pyroll.core
```

The {py:class}`FlatGroove` class represents a smooth flat groove. 
This is used to represent the roll barrel and can be used for rolling flat profiles or in groove rolling processes especially with the `ThreeRollPass`.
Mandatory measures of the flat groove is the usable width $w_\mathrm{u}$, witch in this contact can be replaced with the ca. 90% of the barrel width of the roll to compensate a possible overfill.
The `FlatGroove` is also the default groove of a `Roll`.
